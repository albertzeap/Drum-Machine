# About 

This program simulates a drum machine that is able to create sounds from chosen sound packs based on 
user interaction. User interaction is classified as both clicks and key presses.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Goal

Through the creation of this project, my goal was to deeper understand data flow through components, rendering
based off changes within the program, and component structuring to optimize data flow.
